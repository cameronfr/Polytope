# Polytope

The goal of the Polytope project is to create self sustaining casual creativity. I.e. a creator gets rewarded for the complexity they pursued, the direction they went in, no matter what.

The first iteration tries to do this by 1.) Using the proven (by minecraft) little-barrier-to-entry voxel system 2.) By creating a market for creations 3.) By being easy to approach in that everything happens in the browser. 

### Development Details
- Flask server and Parcel node app automatically built and made live when pushed to master. Might have to clear cache in cloudflare. Contracts deployed manually via Remix IDE.
