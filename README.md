# Polytope

The goal of the Polytope project is to create self sustaining casual creativity. I.e. a creator gets rewarded for the complexity they pursued, the direction they went in, no matter what.

### Development Details
- Flask server and Parcel node app automatically built and made live when pushed to master. Might have to clear cache in cloudflare. Contracts deployed manually via Remix IDE.
